# opencode-image

> **Third-party community image.** This is an unofficial, community-maintained Docker image of [opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode). It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the opencode project.

A minimal Docker image that runs opencode with its built-in web UI (`opencode web`), usable directly with Docker or inside a [MicroSandbox](https://github.com/microsandbox/microsandbox) microVM.

The image is published to GHCR by CI: `ghcr.io/ctxinf/opencode-image` 

## 1. Run with Docker

Quick throwaway run:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 7777:7777 ghcr.io/ctxinf/opencode-image:latest
```

Open http://localhost:7777.

For a persistent deployment use compose (`docker/docker-compose.yml`):

```yaml
services:
  opencode:
    image: ghcr.io/ctxinf/opencode-image:latest
    container_name: opencode
    ports:
      - "7777:7777"
    environment:
      # Without a password opencode logs "server is unsecured" and the web UI
      # is open to anyone who can reach the port. Set it for any real deployment.
      - OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=${OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD:-}
      # Initial workspace dir; created and git-inited on start if missing
      - OPENCODE_WORKDIR=${OPENCODE_WORKDIR:-/workspace}
    volumes:
      - opencode-config:/root/.config/opencode
      - opencode-data:/root/.local/share/opencode
      - workspace:/workspace
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  opencode-config:
  opencode-data:
  workspace:
```

```bash
cd docker
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=change-me docker compose up -d
```

The three named volumes persist across restarts:

| Volume | Mount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `opencode-config` | `/root/.config/opencode` | opencode config (seeded from the image) |
| `opencode-data` | `/root/.local/share/opencode` | sessions / auth / state |
| `workspace` | `/workspace` | your project files |

The baked-in config (`docker/config/opencode.jsonc`) disables sharing, auto-update, LSP and telemetry. API keys are entered in the web UI, not baked into the image.

Runtime env vars:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` | *(unset — unsecured!)* | web UI password |
| `OPENCODE_WORKDIR` | `/workspace` | initial project dir, e.g. `-e OPENCODE_WORKDIR=/workspace/app1` |

The image runs under [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini), so Ctrl+C on a foreground `docker run` stops the container cleanly.

> **Note:** named volumes are seeded from the image only on first creation and keep session history across image upgrades. If the web UI opens an unexpected project dir, it is replaying old sessions from the `opencode-data` volume — remove it (`docker compose down && docker volume rm docker_opencode-data`) for a fresh start.

## 2. Run in MicroSandbox

[`example/microsandbox-run.ts`](example/microsandbox-run.ts) starts the GHCR image in a microVM like `docker run --rm` — the sandbox lives as long as the script:

```bash
npm install
npm run sandbox            # -> http://localhost:17777
npm run sandbox -- 18000   # custom host port
```

Override the image with `OPENCODE_IMAGE=...` if needed.

## 3. Build locally (optional)

Only needed if you want to change the image itself:

```bash
cd docker
docker build -t opencode-image:latest .
# pin a different opencode version:
docker build --build-arg OPENCODE_VERSION=1.15.12 -t opencode-image:latest .
```

The Dockerfile downloads the opencode release tarball at build time — no binaries are checked into the repo.

## CI

- **docker-image.yml** — on tag push `v*` or manual dispatch: builds and pushes `ghcr.io/ctxinf/opencode-image` with `latest`, semver, and commit-SHA tags. A tag `vX.Y.Z` builds opencode `X.Y.Z` and records it in the image description.
- **track-upstream.yml** — twice a month (1st/15th): builds the latest [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) release and pushes it as `latest` + `<version>`, skipping versions already published.
- **check.yml** — type-checks the TypeScript examples with the TypeScript 7 preview (`tsgo --noEmit`).
